Create 10 unique and challenging Dutch sentences at C1 language level that use the imperfect tense.

Requirements:
- All sentences must be original with varied contexts, topics, and sentence structures
- Use sophisticated, varied vocabulary appropriate for C1 level
- Ensure all sentences are grammatically correct and contextually realistic
- Include exactly 2 questions among the 10 sentences
- Include exactly 1 sentence that contains 2 different imperfect tense verbs
- Use a balanced mix of regular and irregular verbs
- Every verb must be unique across all sentences (no verb should appear more than once)
- Include both singular and plural subject forms
- Vary sentence structures and topics to ensure diversity

Format:
- Replace each imperfect tense verb with <mask>
- Return the response in valid JSON format as an array of objects
- Each object must contain: 'question' (the sentence with <mask>), 'answer' (array of conjugated verb(s)), and 'infinitive' (array of infinitive form(s))

Example JSON structure (create completely different sentences, not these exact ones):
[
  {'question': 'Ik <mask> naar de supermarkt.', 'answer': ['ging'], 'infinitive': ['gaan']},
  {'question': 'Waar <mask> jullie gisteren avond?', 'answer': ['waren'], 'infinitive': ['zijn']},
  {'question': 'Ik <mask> thuis en <mask> een koffie.', 'answer': ['bleef', 'dronk'], 'infinitive': ['blijven', 'drinken']}
]

Important: These examples show the JSON structure only. Do not copy these sentence patterns or contexts. Create entirely new sentences with different subjects, objects, and situations.
